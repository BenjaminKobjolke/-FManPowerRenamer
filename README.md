Or just use the "install plugin" function from within fman and search for FManPowerRenamerExtension.

# Usage
Select one or more files and ctrl+shift+p and search for "power renamer"

Then enter your desired filename. Add as many # as you want to have digits.

So if you want files that look like file_01, file_02, file_03 then enter file_##.

If you want more digits, add more # :)
